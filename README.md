# GlassBlock Atlas

A community-driven web application that allows users to document and map the presence of architectural glass blocks in the real world. By leveraging geolocation and user-generated content, the app creates a visual archive of glass blocks from around the world.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Explore glass block installations on an interactive map powered by OpenStreetMap
- **Add New Pins**: Document glass blocks with photos, descriptions, and detailed metadata
- **Geolocation**: Automatically get your current location or manually enter coordinates
- **Rich Metadata**: Include architectural style, building type, unique features, and tags
- **Community-Driven**: All content is saved locally and shared within the community
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Mapping**: React Leaflet with OpenStreetMap
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM

## Usage

### Adding a Glass Block

1. Click the "Add Glass Block" button in the header
2. Fill in the required information:
   - **Title**: A descriptive name for the glass block installation
   - **Description**: Detailed description of the glass block
   - **Location**: Use "Use my current location" or enter coordinates manually
   - **Photo**: Upload a photo of the glass block
3. Optionally add:
   - **Architectural Style**: e.g., Art Deco, Modern, Brutalist
   - **Building Type**: e.g., Office building, Church, School
   - **Unique Features**: Any notable characteristics
   - **Tags**: Keywords to help categorize the installation
4. Click "Add Glass Block" to save

### Exploring the Map

- **View Pins**: All documented glass blocks appear as pins on the map
- **Click Pins**: Click any pin to view detailed information
- **Map Navigation**: Zoom, pan, and explore different areas
- **Location Services**: The map automatically centers on your location when available

### Managing Content

- **Local Storage**: All data is saved locally in your browser

## Data Structure

Each glass block pin contains:

```typescript
interface GlassBlockPin {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  location: {
    lat: number
    lng: number
  }
  imageUrl: string
  architecturalStyle?: string
  buildingType?: string
  uniqueFeatures?: string
  createdAt: string
  tags?: string[]
}
```
